						IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON UN SDG11: SUSTAINABLE CITIES AND COMMUNITIES

				The <b>Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</b> are an important part of
				global society and it is essential that we keep them at the forefront of
				science and policy, especially with a view to moving out of the COVID-19
				crisis.

				<br /><br />

				Decreasing air pollution world-wide is crucial for reaching the UN
				Sustainable Development Goals. Air pollution is estimated to cause seven
				million deaths globally each year¹. Air pollution has also been
				attributed to reduced vegetation health and crop yields². Air quality is
				assessed by levels of: Ozone, Nitrogen Dioxide, Sulphur Dioxide, PM2.5,
				PM10, and carbon monoxide. COVID-19 has caused drastic reductions in
				transport and energy production causing reductions in air pollution.
				This can be seen in the map providing carbon monoxide (CO) levels in
				2019 and 2020. The short-term reductions in air pollution caused by
				COVID-19 highlights the need for improved policy, energy production and
				green transport to sustain reduced air pollution in the long term.

				<br /><br />

				We elected to look into
				<b>SDG 11, Sustainable Cities and Communities</b>, because it is
				important to link the impact of coronavirus to global air pollution and
				then link this back to the impact it has on communities. This will
				enable us to produce a more interdisciplinary, integrated outlook on the
				future and how best to move forward following the pandemic, ensuring to
				keep the environmental crisis we also face in mind. <br /><br />
				Using data from the Canadian Space Agency on Carbon Monoxide (CO)
				concentration and JavaScript’s MapboxGL library, we have plotted a heat
				map of CO concentration in atmospheric columns (mol/m²) across the
				world. There are 2 layers to the map, one for April 2019, and one for
				April 2020, allowing us to compare the CO concentration before and
				during the COVID-19 outbreak. The layers are able to be turned on and
				off individually for clearer comparisons. On zooming in and out of the
				world map, the resolution of the data will change. For example, zooming
				in very close will allow the user to see individual data points, and
				zooming out very far will show a more general trend for that location.
				The code that was produced to create the heatmap could also be used in
				the future to plot more data (perhaps other SDGs) relatively easily, by
				pointing to a new GeoJSON file containing the data to be plotted.
				<br /><br />
				The project was developed in Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code, and a
				GitHub repository was used throughout.
				<br /><br />
				In order to produce the air pollution heat map, we came across these
				problems… and found these solutions… and had these achievements…***
				<br /><br />
				We had also planned to make the link between air pollution and crop
				yield, thereby addressing another important aspect of the SDGs: global
				food security. Pollution has varied but predominantly negative impacts
				on crop yield (NASA, n.d.). Therefore, we thought it important to
				explore this issue because theoretically the coronavirus outbreak and
				thus lockdown has led to a reduction in air pollution, which in turn
				would improve crop yield. This would have been useful to look at the
				effects of COVID-19 in a holistic manner but due to time constraints and
				limited expertise/knowledge, we opted to limit our research to air
				pollution alone.
